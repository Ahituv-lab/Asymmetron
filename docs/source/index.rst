Welcome to Asymmetron's documentation!
======================================


.. centered:: Asymmetron is a set of algorithms that enable the systematic investigation of strand asymmetries across biological problems.


**Quick Summary**

    Brief summary of the problems and settings Asymmetron can be applied to.


**Installation**

    Instructions for the installation of Asymmetron.


**Introduction**

    Background information regarding strand asymmetries.


**Instructions**

    Information on how to implement each of the different functions.

    :doc:`consecutive_patterns <../consecutive_patterns>` 

    :doc:`contained_asymmetries <../contained_asymmetries>` 

    :doc:`pairwise_asymmetries <../pairwise_asymmetries>`

    :doc:`orientation <../orientation>`


**Tutorial**

    We have developed a tutorial that explains how to implement each function and uses brief examples for each function to different biological problems.
